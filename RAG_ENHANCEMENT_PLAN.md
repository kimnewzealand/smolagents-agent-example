# Enhanced Compliance Agent: Web Search + RAG Integration Plan

## Overview
Transform the current compliance agent into a hybrid system that combines real-time web searching with knowledge-based retrieval for comprehensive New Zealand startup compliance assistance.

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- ‚úÖ Web search capability via `ComplianceWebSearchTool`
- ‚úÖ Structured compliance calendar data
- ‚úÖ Multi-tool orchestration with smolagents
- ‚úÖ Focused on NZ regulatory landscape

### Current Limitations
- ‚ùå No persistent knowledge base
- ‚ùå Limited to real-time search results
- ‚ùå No document storage or citation tracking
- ‚ùå Cannot access historical regulatory changes

## Proposed Hybrid Architecture

### 1. Knowledge Base Layer
```
knowledge_base/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core_documents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tax_legislation/     # Income Tax Act, GST Act
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ company_law/         # Companies Act 1993
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employment_law/      # Employment Relations Act
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ health_safety/       # HSWA 2015
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ regulatory_updates/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ird_releases/        # IRD determinations, rulings
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mbie_updates/        # MBIE policy changes
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ companies_office/    # CO announcements
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ practical_guides/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ startup_checklists/  # Step-by-step compliance guides
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ form_templates/      # Official forms with instructions
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ case_studies/        # Common compliance scenarios
```

### 2. Enhanced Tool Suite

#### New RAG Tools
- **`DocumentRetrievalTool`**: Search internal knowledge base
- **`CitationTool`**: Provide specific document references
- **`HistoricalComparisonTool`**: Compare current vs previous regulations
- **`DocumentSummaryTool`**: Summarize long regulatory documents

#### Enhanced Existing Tools
- **`ComplianceWebSearchTool`** ‚Üí **`HybridSearchTool`**:
  - First check knowledge base for established law
  - Use web search for recent updates and news
  - Cross-reference findings between sources

#### New Specialized Tools
- **`RegulationTrackerTool`**: Monitor specific regulation changes
- **`DeadlineCalculatorTool`**: Calculate compliance dates based on business events
- **`RiskAssessmentTool`**: Evaluate compliance risk levels
- **`FormFinderTool`**: Locate and explain required forms

### 3. Intelligent Routing Strategy

#### Query Classification
```python
def classify_query(query: str) -> QueryType:
    """
    ESTABLISHED_LAW: Use knowledge base (e.g., "What is GST rate?")
    RECENT_CHANGES: Use web search (e.g., "Latest tax changes 2024")
    HYBRID: Use both sources (e.g., "How do new PAYE rules affect startups?")
    PROCEDURAL: Use knowledge base + forms (e.g., "How to register company?")
    """
```

#### Tool Selection Logic
1. **Established Law Queries** ‚Üí Knowledge Base First
2. **Recent Updates** ‚Üí Web Search First
3. **Complex Scenarios** ‚Üí Multi-tool orchestration
4. **Deadline Queries** ‚Üí Calendar + Calculator tools

    "content": str,
    "embedding": List[float],
    "metadata": {
        "source": str,          # "IRD", "Companies Office", etc.
        "document_type": str,   # "legislation", "ruling", "guide"
